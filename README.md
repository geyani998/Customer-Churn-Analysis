# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a customer churn prediction project. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can identify churn patterns among telco customers, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain them. The project involved various data preprocessing techniques and the implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate predictive models. The algorithms used were Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest. Explored EDA, data preprocessing, and model building using Pycaret for efficient development. Enhance customer retention strategies with data-driven insights.

Key Features:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive exploration and visualization of the telco customer churn dataset to gain insights into the data.

    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and applying one-hot encoding to prepare the data for model training.

    Model Building: Implementing several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, to predict customer churn.

    Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    Pycaret Integration: Leveraging the Pycaret library to streamline the process of building and comparing multiple machine learning models with minimal code.
